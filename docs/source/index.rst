Welcome to Dig-it's documentation!
==================================

This is a fourth year University of Cape Town computer science honours project. The project was completed by Ethan Marrs and Nathan Begbie, and was supervised by Melissa Densmore. This project is about the creation, management and optimization of mathematical content. The project is based on Dig-it, Praekelt.orgâ€™s mobile learning platform. Dig-it is planning to scale nationally, and a prototype was created to trial new features that might enable the platform to scale in future.
