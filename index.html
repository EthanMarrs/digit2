            A prototype application to improve the creation, management and delivery of mathematics
            content on a mobile E-learning platform. The project was undertaken by Nathan Begbie and

            <hr>
            <p class="text-justify">
                This is a fourth year computer science honours project at the University of Cape Town.
                The project was completed by <a href="https://github.com/ethanmarrs/">Ethan Marrs</a>
                and <a href="https://github.com/nathanbegbie/">Nathan Begbie</a>, and was supervised by
                <a href="http://www.melissadensmore.com/">Melissa Densmore</a>.
                This project is about the creation, management and optimization of mathematical content.
                The project is based on Dig-it, Praekelt.orgâ€™s mobile learning platform. Dig-it is planning to scale
                nationally, and a prototype was created to trial new features that might enable the platform to
                scale in future.

            <h1>Background</h1>
            <hr>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Dig-it is a mathematics mobi-site aimed at high school students. It supplies them with questions on
                a weekly basis and rewards them with airtime if a certain percentage of questions are answered
                correctly. Dig-it currently operates on a small scale with roughly 1500 students from Grades 10 to
                12. Dig-it is built and managed by the Praekelt Foundation and is funded by Investec. Dig-it is
                built with Python and Django, a web framework. In 2017, Dig-it will be scaling to a
                national level of over 100 000 students in 3 provinces. An overview of the current platform workflow
                is indicated below.

            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <hr>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The project had a number of goals:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create a tool that can replace Microsoft Word for creating mathematical content and that stores the
                    data as LaTeX.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create an automated tool to convert the stored data into mobile-first web pages and minimise the
                    size of the content that students would consume.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow for automatic or semi-automatic content availability, which involves making questions
                    available to students at certain points in the syllabus.
                </li>
                <li>Improve the arrangement and selection of questions.</li>
                <li>Reduce dependencies on tools external to the platform</li>
                <li>Create an inclusive system that manages the moderation of questions before their release</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Results</h1>
            <hr>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <img class="center-block" src="img/home.png"/>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <img class="center-block" src="img/Phone_Screenshot.png"/>
                </div>

            <br>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The project resulted in the creation of a fully-functioning prototype. A content creation tool was
                implemented which met all of the functional requirements specified by the client. This allowed for data
                to be stored in an
                intelligent fashion, and for the reduction of the average page size to 41% of the original application.
                The prototype also resulted in the implementation of a new workflow, removing the reliance on three
                tools external to the platform. The new structural design made it possible to deliver questions to
                students automatically, and the application met its functional requirements. Both the content creation
                and optimization, and content management aspects of the project received high usability scores. The
                Dig-it team was enthusiastic about the prototype, and are keen to explore how some of the features might
                be used in the current platform. The new workflow is indicated below.
