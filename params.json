It supplies them with questions on a weekly basis and rewards them with airtime if a certain percentage of questions are answered correctly. Dig-it currently operates on a small scale with roughly 1500 students from Grades 10 to 12. Dig-it is built and managed by the Praekelt Foundation and is funded by Investec. Dig-it is built with Python and Django, a web framework. In the next year, Dig-it will be scaling to a national level of over 100 000 students in 3 provinces. Various stakeholders engage in the content creation process through various platforms, with multiple stages of the process managed by different systems. As Dig-it scales, it requires tools to manage this scaling effectively, through better content creation and management systems. Dig-it needs to be an inclusive platform that allows for full control of content creation and content management in one place. \r\n\r\n### Project Aims\r\nThe aims of this project are to:\r\n* Allow content creators to create content within the platform in order to store the underlying data as LaTeX and text rather than images and text, and to optimize the content delivery system.\r\n* Internalize the syllabus and content management within the platform as much as possible, for intuitive use by stakeholders, to manage the content as the platform scales.\r\n* Automate parts of content management system as identified by the client.\r\n* Reduce the load size of the pages that are sent to learners.\r\n\r\n### Research Questions\r\nWhile not a research project, we wish to answer the following questions as the focus of this software engineering project:\r\n* To what extent can the mathematical content be created by the platform, specifically with regards to equations by introducing a WYSIWYG equation editor?\r\n* To what degree can a content management system reduce the reliance on external tools for coordinating content workflows?\r\n* By what percentage can we decrease the average page size of questions and answers sent to students?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
