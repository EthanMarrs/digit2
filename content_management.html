            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">
                This paper presents the development of a prototype application for managing mathematical content. The
                project is based on Dig-it, Praekelt.org’s mobile learning platform. Dig-it is planning to scale
                nationally, and a prototype was created to trial new features that might enable the platform to
                sustainably manage content in future. Among many things, the paper discusses an approach to the design
                of an e-learning Content Management System, with emphasis on automating workflows and allowing for
                effective arrangement of syllabus content. This involved an aim to reduce the reliance on tools external
                to the platform. The project was evaluated using a few metrics, including a user evaluation using the
                System Usability Scale. The evaluation showed that the prototype successfully provided a way to manage
                mathematics content, and stakeholder feedback indicated that the prototype had met its functional
                requirements, providing ideas and approaches for future work on the Dig-it platform.

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The education space has been a focus of computer science innovation for some time now. In South Africa,
                a number of initiatives have researched technology as a platform for learning – so called “e-learning”.
                These projects have differed greatly in scope and goals, with some operating as for-profit ventures
                while others are backed by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).
                A common target of these projects has been STEM fields, particularly mathematics given South Africa’s
                problematic international ranking in the subject [18]. This background has led to the creation of
                Dig-it, a non-profit mathematics platform operated by Praekelt.org and recently funded by Investec.
                Dig-it provides a mobi-site for high school students where they are provided questions on a weekly basis
                and rewarded with airtime for reaching certain goals. A common goal for students is answering more than
                60% of questions correctly. Currently, Dig-it operates on a small scale with roughly 1500 active
                students using the platform from grades 10 through to 12.
