                <h2>A Prototype System for Managing Mathematics Content</h2>
                <p class="lead">By Ethan Marrs</p>
            </div>
            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">
                This paper presents the development of a prototype application for managing mathematical content. The
                project is based on Dig-it, Praekelt.org’s mobile learning platform. Dig-it is planning to scale
                nationally, and a prototype was created to trial new features that might enable the platform to
                sustainably manage content in future. Among many things, the paper discusses an approach to the design
                of an e-learning Content Management System, with emphasis on automating workflows and allowing for
                effective arrangement of syllabus content. This involved an aim to reduce the reliance on tools external
                to the platform. The project was evaluated using a few metrics, including a user evaluation using the
                System Usability Scale. The evaluation showed that the prototype successfully provided a way to manage
                mathematics content, and stakeholder feedback indicated that the prototype had met its functional
                requirements, providing ideas and approaches for future work on the Dig-it platform.

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The education space has been a focus of computer science innovation for some time now. In South Africa,
                a number of initiatives have researched technology as a platform for learning – so called “e-learning”.
                These projects have differed greatly in scope and goals, with some operating as for-profit ventures
                while others are backed by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).
                A common target of these projects has been STEM fields, particularly mathematics given South Africa’s
                problematic international ranking in the subject [18]. This background has led to the creation of
                Dig-it, a non-profit mathematics platform operated by Praekelt.org and recently funded by Investec.
                Dig-it provides a mobi-site for high school students where they are provided questions on a weekly basis
                and rewarded with airtime for reaching certain goals. A common goal for students is answering more than
                60% of questions correctly. Currently, Dig-it operates on a small scale with roughly 1500 active
                students using the platform from grades 10 through to 12.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                In 2017, Dig-it is scaling to the national level, aiming to service over 100 000 students in 3
                provinces. For a number of reasons, Dig-it’s current workflow and codebase need to be adjusted to cater
                for this expansion. The primary concerns regarding the current system are the creation of mathematical
                content, the management of content and curricula, and optimizing the delivery of this content to
                students.
            </p>
            <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The proposed solution was to create a prototype which demonstrates possible features for the project to
                scale in future. The prototype was built from the ground up, focussing on our areas of interest and
                research questions. This project is a proof of concept, and a potential reference design.
            </p>
            <h3>Aims</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The primary aims of the project are to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow for automatic or semi-automatic content availability, which involves making questions
                    available to students at certain points in the syllabus
                </li>
                <li>Improve the arrangement and selection of questions</li>
                <li>Reduce dependencies on tools external to the platform</li>
                <li>Create an inclusive system that manages the moderation of questions before their release</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Design</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Given the software engineering nature of the project, design was an important aspect of the project’s
                planning and incremental improvement. Early on is the planning stages, it was decided that user
                involvement was key to the success of the project, and so a form of User-Centred Design was adopted. As
                mentioned previously, this required regular meetings with Praekelt.org stakeholders involving
                demonstrations, sketches, clarifications and discussions.
                Overall, the content management aspect of the project had three primary design focusses. The first was
                the technical design of the application, involving system architecture, design patterns and programming
                decisions. The second focus was on realising the user stories defined by stakeholders, and thus the
                information flows that are involved. The final focus was on the user interface and visual aspects of the
                system – how the design could best aid the user in constructing syllabi and content.
            </p>
            <h3>General Design</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The design for the prototype is based on the idea that the structure of a syllabus should be determined
                by the weeks in a year. By using ISO week numbers (each week is numbered between 1 and 52, occasionally
                53 in leap years) instead of specific dates, content can be reused in the next year with few changes to
                the underlying data.
                This means that a syllabus is made up of topics with specific start and end weeks. Topics are then
                broken into blocks, which are then associated with questions. Blocks are a week long, but could be of
                arbitrary length, hence their naming. Students will be delivered questions that are at most two weeks
                behind the current date, introducing the idea of a 2 week “moving window” of content. This helps prevent
                the predicament of students falling behind in the syllabus. The final concept introduced is that of a
                question creation task. This is a task set up to request the creation of
                questions for a given topic. This then encapsulates the content creation and moderation processes. The
                implementation of these concepts through Django models and hence database tables, is
                described visually in the model diagram, available in the online appendices.
            </p>
            <h3>Use Cases</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                The use cases for the Dig-it prototype were developed collaboratively with the Dig-it project manager
                and content uploader. Some use cases were identified through the scheduled project meetings, while
                others were identified during a specific use case session. The minutes of these meetings can be found
                online, alongside the output from the use case session.
                The new Dig-it workflow was designed alongside the use cases, and is described below. Two use case
                diagrams have been created to describe the requirements of the system. The first
                is the simplest, and describes the student’s view of Dig-it, the second use case diagram relates to the
                administration aspect of the system, and involves five key actors: syllabus creator, content creator,
                content moderator, project manager and time.

            <h3>New Workflow</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                To meet the design objective of automating aspects of the original system and unifying processes, a new
                workflow needed to be designed.An important part of this new workflow involves the state of questions.
                The figure below describes how questions can progress from the state of “incomplete” to “complete”. A
                question
                transitions between these states based on interactions between the content creators, content moderators
                and platform manager.

            <h1>Conclusions</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">
                A prototype system for managing mathematical content was developed in an attempt to address some of the
                issues currently facing the Dig-it platform. A special emphasis was placed on reducing the reliance on
                tools external to the platform, and improving the arrangement of curricula for students. With regards to
                our research questions, it appears as though a custom CMS can certainly reduce the reliance on external
                tools, especially when their current usage is limited. For Dig-it, this included spreadsheets and task
                tracking software. The reliance on email as a communication tool was also reduced, but it was noted that
                email is used elsewhere in the organisation, and so it would be likely users will continue to fall back
                on its usage, regardless. Visual elements in the prototype were well received, especially when they
                provided an overview of Dig-it content that improved upon the usage of spreadsheets. Hence, timelines
                and overview screens proved to be the most effective in conveying complex curricula information to
                administrators.
                The new approach to the design of the system, using the weeks of the year instead of fixed dates,
                allowed for the structuring of syllabi such that questions could be made available to students as soon
                as they were completed. This new structure did result in some confusion with the CMS interface however,
                despite iteration on the initial designs. This indicates that there is room for improvement in this
                area. Somewhat unexpectedly, the interface ended up being quite challenging both from design and
                technical perspectives.
                Ultimately, we believe that we have met our overall aim for the project, to help provide new ideas and
                approaches for the Dig-it platform to scale effectively in future.
            </p>
            <h1>Future Work</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">
                This paper has focussed mainly on the content management implications for Dig-it in future. Through the
                implementation of a prototype, it seems clear that there are several possibilities for streamlining the
                platform and improving operational efficiency. One aspect of this is automating the creation of
                mathematical content. For a small platform, it would be possible to continue using a variety of tools to
                manage content creation, but it appears as though this process would become increasingly difficult as
                the platform scales.
                The second aspect is how this content is managed sustainably. This prototype has demonstrated that
                incorporating functionality for content moderation is useful to the administrators of the platform, and
                that arrangement of questions on a single system can improve the usability of the overall platform. This
                may be an area of future work for the project. It can also be said that features that were specifically
                determined as out of scope, might be an area of future work for the prototype. This could include
                integrating leaderboards and gamification into the new application design and workflow.
                The project also devised a method to allow for questions to be delivered to students without manual
                intervention. While this appeared to work in our testing, more research needs to be done to ascertain
                whether this is a suitable approach for a production system.
